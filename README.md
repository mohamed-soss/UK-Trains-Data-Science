# UK Train Data Analysis

This project analyzes UK train ticket data to gain insights into ticket purchases, journey statuses, and potential forecasting of ride counts. The dataset includes information about ticket transactions, travel details, and journey outcomes, which are preprocessed and visualized to understand patterns and trends.

The analysis uses two main datasets: railway.csv, which contains detailed records of train ticket transactions including purchase details, ticket types, journey times, and status (e.g., on-time, delayed, or canceled), and railway_data_dictionary.csv, which provides descriptions of the fields in the railway.csv dataset.

Key fields in the data include Transaction ID (unique identifier for each ticket purchase), Date/Time of Purchase, Purchase Type (Online or at the station), Payment Method (Contactless, Credit Card, etc.), Ticket Class/Type (Standard/First class, Advance/Off-Peak, etc.), Price, Departure/Arrival Stations and Times, Journey Status (On Time, Delayed, or Canceled), Reason for Delay (if applicable), and Refund Request.

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Project structure includes: UK_Trains.ipynb (Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization code), railway.csv (main dataset with train ticket records), railway_data_dictionary.csv (data dictionary explaining the fields), and README.md (this file with the project overview).

Usage steps: Clone the repository with git clone <repository-url>, navigate to the project directory with cd <project-directory>, ensure the required datasets (railway.csv and railway_data_dictionary.csv) are present, open the notebook with jupyter notebook UK_Trains.ipynb, and run all cells to preprocess the data, clean it, and generate visualizations including a forecast of ride counts for the next month.

Analysis highlights include preprocessing and cleaning of the data by handling missing values and formatting dates/times, as well as visualization with plots of historical ride counts and a forecast for the next month using matplotlib.

Future improvements could involve adding advanced forecasting models (such as ARIMA or Prophet) for better ride count predictions, analyzing delay patterns by station or ticket type, and incorporating additional datasets like weather data for deeper insights.
