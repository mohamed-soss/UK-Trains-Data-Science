# UK Train Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes UK train ticket data to gain insights into ticket purchases, journey statuses, and potential forecasting of ride counts. The dataset includes information about ticket transactions, travel details, and journey outcomes, which are preprocessed and visualized to understand patterns and trends.

---

## Dataset
The analysis uses two main datasets:

- **railway.csv**: Contains detailed records of train ticket transactions, including purchase details, ticket types, journey times, and status (e.g., on-time, delayed, or canceled).
- **railway_data_dictionary.csv**: Provides descriptions of the fields in the railway.csv dataset.

### Key Fields
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each ticket purchase.
- **Date/Time of Purchase**: When the ticket was bought.
- **Purchase Type**: Online or at the station.
- **Payment Method**: Contactless, Credit Card, etc.
- **Ticket Class/Type**: Standard/First class, Advance/Off-Peak, etc.
- **Price**: Ticket cost.
- **Departure/Arrival Stations and Times**: Journey details.
- **Journey Status**: On Time, Delayed, or Canceled.
- **Reason for Delay**: Cause of delay or cancellation, if applicable.
- **Refund Request**: Whether a refund was requested.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
````

## Project Structure

```
UK_Trains.ipynb              # Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization code
railway.csv                  # Main dataset with train ticket records
railway_data_dictionary.csv  # Data dictionary explaining the fields in railway.csv
README.md                    # Project overview and usage instructions
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Ensure the required datasets are in the project directory** (`railway.csv` and `railway_data_dictionary.csv`).

4. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook UK_Trains.ipynb
   ```

5. **Run the cells** to preprocess the data, clean it, and generate visualizations, including a forecast of ride counts for the next month.

## Analysis Highlights

* **Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Loads and processes the datasets, handling missing values and formatting dates/times.
* **Visualization**: Includes a plot of historical ride counts and a forecast for the next month using matplotlib.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add more advanced forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for better ride count predictions.
* Analyze delay patterns by station or ticket type.
* Incorporate additional datasets for deeper insights (e.g., weather data affecting delays).
